# Friends of Idan - A Social Networking App

Hi, I'm Idan, and welcome to my social app - a social network full-stack app.

## Core Functionalities

- Users can register and are authenticated throughout
- Users can create new posts and delete their posts
- Users can add and delete comments on their posts
- Users can add and remove friends
- Users can upload pictures
- Users can like and unlike posts
- Users can share their posts

I used a list of cutting-edge technologies to build both the front and the back end.

## The Front

The front end was crafted using:

- React and React Router
- Material UI
- JsonWebToken
- Redux Toolkit
- Formik: Form submission
- yup: Form validation

## The Back

The back end was crafted using:

- node.js/ Express.js
- MongoDb and Mongoose
- Multer
- Cloudinary (image hosting)
- Morgan for automatic logs
- CORS and Helmet for app security

Feel free to ask me about it!
